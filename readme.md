### Services

Docker services used on [docker-compose. yml](https://github.com/sarahcssiqueira/docker-wordpress/blob/master/docker/docker-compose.yml):

- **db**

The MYSQL official image.

- **phpMyAdmin**

Intended to handle the administration of MySQL, in this case through port 80, on browser [localhost:8080/](localhost:8080/).

- **WordPress**

Uses the official WordPress latest docker image.

- **WP-CLI**

The **wpcli container** was added to only run one-off commands. Donâ€™t need it to run as a service, only as a cli tool, for that run:

`docker-compose run --rm wpcli command`

## Requirements

- [Docker](https://www.docker.com/) hub installed.

## Usage

Clone this repository `git clone https://github.com/sarahcssiqueira/docker-wordpress`
then cd the **docker folder** `cd docker` and set up your chosen variables on the .env file.

### Variables

The variables used for WordPress installation are the following ones, you can use the same or change them, it's up to you.

```
MYSQL_DATABASE_NAME=exampledatabase
MYSQL_USER=exampleuser
MYSQL_PASSWORD=examplepass
WORDPRESS_PORT=8000
```

---

> WARNING: DO NOT store your variables on a .env file if it's not a local development environment, for other cases, the appropriate method is to add the .env file to a .gitignore and store the variables as [encrypted secrets.](https://docs.github.com/en/actions/security-guides/encrypted-secrets)

---

After setting your variables, run `docker-compose up -d` to start the docker.

When docker finished their work (which can take a few minutes the first time, depending on your connection and machine) by opening your browser through http://localhost:8000, you should see the WordPress default installation screen.

Finish WordPress installation and in your terminal, cd the root project folder again type `cd ..` to start working on your plugins and/or themes.

For using wp-cli, use `docker-compose run --rm wpcli command` as it was added to only run one-off commands

The wp-core is synchronized too, just in case you need to check and/or debug something.
