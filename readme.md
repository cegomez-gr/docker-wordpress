## Usage

Clone this repository, then cd the **docker folder** and run `docker-compose up -d` to start your project.

## Services

- **db**

The MYSQL official image

- **phpMyAdmin**

Intended to handle the administration of MySQL, in this case through [localhost:8080/](localhost:8080/).

- **WordPress**

Uses the official WordPress docker image

- **WP-CLI**

The **wpcli container** was added in order to only run one-off commands. Donâ€™t need it to run as a service, only as a cli tool, for that run:

`docker-compose run --rm wpcli command`
