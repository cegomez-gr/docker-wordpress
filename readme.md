    }

## Services

- db 

The MYSQL official image

- phpMyAdmin

Intended to handle the administration of MySQL, in this case through [localhost:8080/](localhost:8080/).

- WordPress

Uses the official WordPress docker image

- WP-CLI

The **wpcli container** was added in order to only run one-off commands. Donâ€™t need it to run as a service, only as a cli tool, for that run:

`docker-compose run --rm wpcli command`
